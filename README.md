# DS340-project
DS 340 Project: NN for image classification of suitcase x-ray's.

## Dataset
Dataset: https://universe.roboflow.com/airport-security-scanning/airport-security-scans-dataset

5 classifications: Folding Knife, Multi-tool Knife, Scissor, Straight Knife, Utility Knife

Currently have played around with:

* VGG16 ~ 34%
* ResNet (I've tried freezing and unfreezing layers, adding dropout layers, etc.) ~ 36% best accuracy.  

Professor Gold said: look for NN architecture that works with high resolution pictures given the quality of the images from the dataset. 

## Try to make a drastic increase in accuracy, doesn't have to be perfect.
Need to figure out how to lower loss. (Overfitting)

Which parameters work best?

Everything takes so long to run...
